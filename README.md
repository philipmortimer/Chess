This is a complete chess application coded by me. This was developed for A level coursework in Computer Science. I receieved full marks for my coursework. This application is a chess application to be used by a local chess club.
The "Server" folder contains the server side application and "User" contains the user application. "Coursework" contains my coursework submission and relevant documents. Note some documents in "Coursework" have been altered or not included due to GitHub file size restrictions. "Neural" contains some of the snippets of code used to train my neural network to play chess. Note that this section is most impacted by GitHub file size restrictions (and system memeory requirements). This is not the exact code, I used to train the network as this file was largely used expiremently (and hence altered frequently).
